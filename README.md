# LXFarm

DogFarm consists of: a list of the Dogs (dog can be a puppy, an adult, an elderly); list of ServingStaff, list of Veterinarians.

A Dog needs to be fed twice daily, checked by a Veterinarian and served by the ServingStaff.

Every morning the dogs become older and get sick randomly. Veterinarian checks each Dog, if the dog is not healthy - treats, and declares a dog ready for work (other duties). Serving staff works only with Dogs inspected by the Veterinarian. Serving staff trains puppies, sends the dogs to work or to rest in order to empty the aviary and to clean the aviary only when it's empty. When all the aviaries cleaned, dogs can come back to their aviaries and can eat for the second time. Then the day is over.
